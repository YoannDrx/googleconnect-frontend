#  📚 Memory Game

Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

The goal of this challenge is to create an application that allows users to log in via Google and display the name and email associated with the user's account (a Google account is required for this challenge). Take the time to read the documentation to add a Google login button:

- **[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-oauth/google](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-oauth/google)**
- **[https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/frameworks/java/creating-client-ids](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/frameworks/java/creating-client-ids)**

👉 Add the Google login button to the indicated location in the code. Upon clicking, you should be able to log in to the application and retrieve the name and email associated with the account. These hints will be useful:

- You will need to add a test user (your email with which you will test the login) to the OAuth consent screen.
- The response received via the @react-oauth/google module will contain a character string "credential" that will need to be decoded via the jwt-decode module: **[https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode)**

👉 When the user is logged in, modify the Home page to display only "Welcome" followed by the user's name and email as in the second mockup.

This challenge is suitable for developers who want to improve their skills with React and OAuth integration. Feel free to fork this project and start coding!
